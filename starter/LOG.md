| 9/13  |       8:00pm |       2:00 | read assignment, worked out examples, and wrote pseudocode                                                            |

| 9/14  |       8:00pm |       4:30 | wrote main code, and did a LOT of debugging. turns out I misinterpreted the rules. Code passes all examples           |

# Collaboration
I discussed my solution with my ULAs

# Discussion
I thought I understood the precise rules, but I did in fact not. This caused some debugging issues at the end, but the fundamental structure of the code was still sound so it wasn't too much of an issue.
