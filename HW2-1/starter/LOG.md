# Actual time to complete assignment
| Date  | Time Started | Time Spent | Work completed                                                                                                        |
| :---: | -----------: | ---------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 9/28  |       6:00pm |       3:00 | read assignment, worked out examples, and wrote pseudocode                                                            |
| 9/30  |       5:00pm |       9:00 | wrote the bulk of the functions, and outlined a plan for tackling the sorting issue                                                                |
| 10/1  |       10:00am|       4:30 | wrote a lot more code after rereading some of the documentation, outlined quicksort function| 
| 10/2  |       5:00pm |       3:00 | wrote my quicksort algorithm! And finished up the other functions that I had missed          |
| 10/3  |       5:00pm |       4:30 | started testing and wow everything broke, so bug fixing           |
| 10/4  |       2:00pm |       8:00 | realized that I fundamentally approached the pset wrong, started almost from scratch |
|10/7   |       4:00pm |       6:00 | FInally finished, passed tests
|       |              |       38:00 | total time spent                                                                                                      |

# Collaboration
I discussed my solution with my ULAs, and skylar and Praktsiha.

# Discussion
I thought I understood the precise rules, but I did in fact not. Also, I approached this pset by coding the entire things and then trying to worry about the consequences afterwards but that seriously backfired on me and required me to rewrite almost the entire code. Going forward I will make sure not to fail to test my code after every single addition, mno matter how small they may be. I think its a fundamental part of not spending 38 hours on you pset.
