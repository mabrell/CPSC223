# Collaboration
I discussed my solution with my ULAs, and skylar and Praktsiha.

# Discussion
I enjoyed getting used to trees, and I think the length and difficulty of this pset was good: difficult but manageable. I also thought having to interpret the starter code was most of the hard part but I think its actually useful for industry, as in getting used to working within existing code bases rather than coding everything from the ground up yourself.
