# Collaboration
I discussed my solution with my ULAs, and skylar and Praktsiha.

# Discussion
I ran into an insane amount of segmentation faults, as well as had to fix the bugs that I hadn't found in my previous code, so it took a very significant amount of time. I'm pretty satisfied with my work process this time around however, as I made sure to outline my code and very carefully plan out my steps before I dove headfirst into coding. I also tested very frequently which, while taking a while, made me much more confident in the functionality of my code.
